Notes - 19th Apr, '23

- AWS Services are region-based. If any are unavailable, the user must reselect a region where it's supported.


IAM:Identity and Access Management

- IAM is a global service
- Users and Groups definitions. Groups can only contain users. Exception: root
- Policy/Permission through JSON
- Utilize Least Privilege Principle for user access

- Best advised to login as an IAM user in general instead of root (why?)
- By setting an alias, you can create an AWS login page for your users

- Policies are additive if user is present across multiple groups
- Policies can also be inline i.e., specific to a user without a group

- IAM Policy Struct JSON  
- One can create policies with custom actions 

- AWS accessed through Management Console, CLI or SDK
- AWS CLI is bulit on AWS SDK for Python named Boto (what?)
- All users can login to CLI through Access keys under Security Credentials of IAM/Users

- IAM Roles for AWS Services can be assigned just like users
	- EC2 Instance roles
	- Lambda f roles
	- CloudFormation roles

- IAM Credentials Report (user-lvl) and IAM Access Advisor (acc-lvl) can be generated to review security of AWS 

EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud (IaaS)

contains EC2 (name, Cloud VM), EBS (???, Cloud storage), ELB (Elastic Load Bouncer, ???), ASG (Auto Scaling Group, scaling services)

Configs:

- OS

- RAM

- Storage
	- Network-attached Storage (EBS, EFS)
	- hardware (EC2 Instance Store ???)

- Network card, Public IP

- Firewall rules: sec grp

- Bootstrap ???: automate tasks at launch

Note: EC2 User data script runs with root user

The public IP may change upon reboot of EC2 but the private IP remains const.

Instance types: mainly across computation, memory (RAM) and networking.

EC2 Instance Name convention: Instance class + Generation + . Size of computer like e.g. m6.2xlarge

Security group rules can reference by IP or security grp.???
